Glossygloss is set of classes to use several data structures, C++ containers. More might come soon.

\subsubsection*{Documentation}

All documented things are \href{http://blasterbug.github.io/glossygloss/}{\tt here}.

A P\-D\-F file {\itshape refman.\-pdf} is also available for offline doc.

You can generate the doc using \href{http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/}{\tt doxygen} and the config file {\itshape doxygen\-\_\-config}

\subsubsection*{Compilation}

Here is a sort intance showing how to compile and 'use' \hyperlink{hashtable_8hpp}{hashtable.\-hpp}. It works as well for others files.

We use C++11, so to compile using our classes\-:

\$ g++ -\/std=c++0x -\/\-Wall -\/pedantic -\/o sample\-\_\-hashtable.\-bin \hyperlink{sample__hashtable_8cpp}{sample\-\_\-hashtable.\-cpp}

\subsubsection*{Testing and usage}

Once you compiled \hyperlink{sample__hashtable_8cpp}{sample\-\_\-hashtable.\-cpp}, you can run the code using, assuming you are using an U\-N\-I\-X system.

\$ chmod +x sample\-\_\-hashtable.\-bin

First give execution permission to the compiled code.

\$ ./sample\-\_\-hashtable.bin lorem quod 50

And then, run the program. Words in the first file (lorem) will be maped to the words in quod. The last argument stands for the words number you want to put in the hashtable.
